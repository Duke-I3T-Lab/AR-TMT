## Overview
![Overview](assets/teaser.png)
Despite the growing use of AR in safety-critical domains, the field lacks a systematic understanding of how different types of distraction affect user attention in AR environments. To address this gap, we present **AR-TMT**, an AR adaptation of the Trail Making Test that spatially renders targets for sequential selection on the Magic Leap 2. We implemented distractions in three categories: top-down, bottom-up, and spatial distraction based on Wolfe's Guided Search model, and captured performance, gaze, motor behavior, and subjective load measures to analyze attention and behavior.
